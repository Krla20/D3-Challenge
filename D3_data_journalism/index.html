          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <br>
          <p>There appears to be a positive correlation between the lack of Healthcare and in Poverty. Southern states
            tend to have the highest rates of poverty and least amount of healthcare coverage (with Texas being an outlier as it
            has the highest % lacking healthcare) while some northern states have the lowest rates of poverty and
            better healthcare.</p>
            <p>Current status 2019-2020:</p>
            <br>
          <li>
            Counties included in our poorest “states” come from 13 actual states (AL, AR, GA, IL, KY, LA, MS, OK, SC, SD,
            TN, TX, and WV).
          <li>
            Counties in the wealthiest “states” come from 20 actual states (AK, CA, CO, CT, GA, IL, IN, KY, MD, MA, MN,
            OH, NJ, NM, NY, PA, UT, TN, TX, and VA).
          </li>
          <li>
            The U.S. Census Bureau announced on September 15th, 2020 that median household income in 2019 increased 6.8% from 2018,
            and the official poverty rate decreased 1.3 percentage points. Meanwhile, the percentage of people with health insurance
            coverage for all or part of 2019 was 92.0% and 8.0% of people, or 26.1 million, did not have health insurance at any point
            during 2019, according to the 2020 Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC).
